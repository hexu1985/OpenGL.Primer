Chapter 6 programs:

shadedcube.c: interactive rotating cube with shading. The keyboard can be
used to alter both the lighting and the material properties.

figure.c: same as the program from Chapter 5 but using shaded quadrics  

figuretr.c: same as the program from Chapter 5 but using shaded quadrics  

dynamic.c: same as figuretr.c but uses dynamic nodes  

cubet.c: rotating cube with tranparency. The code makes the z buffer read only for
translucent polygons but does not sort the polygons by depth.
